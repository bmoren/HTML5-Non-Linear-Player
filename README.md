### HTML5-Non-Linear-Player

A random/non-linear browser based video player built in HTML5
by Ben Moren for MCAD Media2 Classes

#### Usage:
Load up as many MP4 clips into the `/data` folder as you would like and change the `totalClips` in the `app_nue.js` settings to reflect the amount of video clips present.

Files must be named with an `integer + '.mp4'` for example: `1.mp4`, `2.mp4`, `3.mp4`, etc. Files must start at `1.mp4` and can go as high as you like. For example: `9234294.mp4`

Open `index.html` in chrome to get started.

#### modes
+ <b>linear:</b> Plays through the clips in order
+ <b>random:</b> uses JavaScript's Math.random() function to choose a random clip
+ <b>non-repeating-rand:</b> this mode will never play the same clip back to back, this eliminates visible random runs.
